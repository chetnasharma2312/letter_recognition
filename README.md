# letter_recognition
This code explores the ability of classification techniques in machine learning to correctly guess the letter categories correlated with 16 attributes extracted from raster
scan images of the alphabet. The classification techniques implemented and compared in this code are the decision tree, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, 
and support vector machine algorithm. The performance of these techniques is compared by calculating their expected accuracy on testing data and
visualizing using confusion matrices and classification report. Also, the best-performing algorithm (SVM Non-Linear model) is validated using 10-fold cross-validation.

The dataset used in this code is the "Letter Recognition" dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
